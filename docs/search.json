This would make sense because broad spectrum antibiotics typically generate selective pressure against the bacteria, causing them to mutate or transfer resistant inducing genes meanwhile, not so common antibiotics like Penicillin are more effective.","title":"full_data","text":"","code":"ggplot(data = Rxresistance, mapping = aes(x = Year, y= Tetracycline, color = Tetracycline)) +    geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) #> Warning: Removed 250 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`)."},{"path":[]},{"path":"/authors.html","id":null,"dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Authors","title":"Authors and Citation","text":"Damian .
