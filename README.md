The dataset contains phenotype data that will be used to predict microbial resistance to antibiotics

# Why did I choose this dataset
I chose this dataset, because neisseria gonorrheae, an acute bacterium that causes gonorrheae in humans, is relatively difficult to cultivate and study due to its specific environmental conditions it requires. By predicting antibiotic resistance, we can recognize whether evolutionary mechanisms like horizontal gene transfer or genetic expression is the critical factor in microbial resistance.

# From the dataset that I chose
This dataset shows that while broad spectrum antibiotics like tetracycline are beginning to have little to no effect on microbes in both the U.S and Europe, more specific-course antibiotics like ceftriaxone and azithromycin have more effect but in recent epidemiological trends, that is starting to not look the case
